### Hello! :)

Hi! I'm Sophie Zhang (they/them) and I'm currently a second-year MPH student in Epidemiology with a certificate in Biostatistics at Columbia Mailman School of Public Health. I'm an avid baker and fall-weather enthusiast, and am excited to give back to the communities I'm a part of through public health research!

Here's a direct link if you'd like to learn more about [my background and experience](experience.html). You can also navigate to this page using the `Experience` tab at the top.

For this assignment, I've also created a [a flexdashboard](flexdashboard.html) that you can use to interactively explore data from `Instacart`. You can also navigate to this page using the `flexdashboard` tab at the top.

### About this site

I created this website for [P8105: Data Science I](https://p8105.com/), a class that I'm currently taking. This specific site was created for Homework 4, and hopefully I'll make an updated personal website in the future!
